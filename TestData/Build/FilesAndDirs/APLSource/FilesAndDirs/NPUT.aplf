⍝ The purpose of this function is to cover `⎕NPUT` and make sure that the filename is normalized.\\
⍝ In addition the function tries to overcome FILE ACCESS ERRROs twice. They are pretty common these days with
⍝ tools like DropBox etc.\\
⍝ The left as well as the right argument must be the same as for a call to the native `⎕NPUT`.
