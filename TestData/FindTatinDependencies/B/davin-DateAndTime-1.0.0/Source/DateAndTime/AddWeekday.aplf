 next←{count}AddWeekday JJJ
⍝ Given a "Julian Day Number", add one (or the specified number of)
⍝ week days and return the new date.  This automatically skips over
⍝ weekends, so adding 1 to a Friday date gives a Monday date, and
⍝ adding 2 gives a Tuesday date.  Starting dates which fall on weekends
⍝ are automatically adjusted to Monday before counting begins.
⍝ Code for DayOfWeek is embedded into this function.
⍝ Any rank & shape array accepted.  See "Describe" for more details.
