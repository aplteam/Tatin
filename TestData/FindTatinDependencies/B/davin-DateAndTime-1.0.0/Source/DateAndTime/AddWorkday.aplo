 next←{count}(isholiday AddWorkday)JJJ;chk0;days
⍝ Given a "Julian Day Number", add one (or the specified number of)
⍝ work days and return the new date.  This automatically skips over
⍝ weekends and holidays, so adding 1 to a Friday date gives a Monday
⍝ date, and adding 2 gives a Tuesday date.  Starting dates which fall
⍝ on weekends or holidays are automatically adjusted to the next work
⍝ day before counting begins.
⍝ Holidays are determined by calling the left operand function.
⍝ It should return a 1 for each item of the argument if that date is
⍝ a holiday, and a 0 if it is not.
⍝ See an example of such a function named ExampleHoliday, which
⍝ determines holidays based on the standard rules of U.S. banking.
⍝ Code for DayOfWeek is embedded into this function.
⍝ Any rank & shape array accepted.  See "Describe" for more details.
