⍝ Convert a "Julian Day Number" to a Gregorian-style date (YYYYMMDD).
⍝ If optional left argument "expand" is specified as an integer ∊⍳7, then
⍝ each result will be separated into component values like ⎕TS and nested
⍝ into a vector in each item in the result.  The number provided indicates
⍝ the number of elements in each nested vector, usually 3 or 7.
⍝ The input values may optionally specify a timestamp value by providing
⍝ a fractional number with the fraction representing a particular time of
⍝ day (starting at midnight) as a fraction of a whole day.  If a time is
⍝ specified in this way, then the returned result will also be fractional
⍝ and return the timestamp in the form YYYYMMDD.HHMMSSTTT, or as a nested
⍝ multi-item vector (in ⎕TS form) if the left argument is provided (see above).
⍝ ⎕DT is used if available, but if timestamps are included then this
⍝ function defines xxx.0 as midnight beginning the day instead of noon in
⍝ the middle of that day (as ⎕DT determines it), for convenience.
⍝ A scalar 0 will be translated to a value of 0 (or vector of 0s), for
⍝ convenience of handling missing dates in numeric arrays.
⍝ Any rank & shape array accepted.  See "Describe" for more details.
