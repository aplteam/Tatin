⍝ Convert a Gregorian-style date (YYYYMMDD) to a "Julian Day Number".
⍝ If any item of the input is nested, then that date is assumed to be
⍝ separated into a 3-item nested vector containing separate numeric
⍝ values for year, month, and day.
⍝ Dates may optionally include a "time" portion to produce a "timestamp"
⍝ value.  Optionally nested items (as described above) may have 5, 6, or 7
⍝ items instead of just 3 to indicate hours, minutes, seconds, or
⍝ milliseconds.  Standard integers are extended to allow non-integer
⍝ values in the format (YYYYMMDD.HHMMSSTTT).  If either of these optional
⍝ formats are used, the result will not be an integer and the fractional
⍝ portion will be the numeric fraction of a day representing that time.
⍝ ⎕DT is used if available, but xxx.0 is defined as midnight beginning the
⍝ day instead of noon in the middle of that day, for convenience.
⍝ A scalar 0 (or vector of 0s) will be translated to a value of 0, for
⍝ convenience of handling missing dates in numeric arrays.
⍝ Any rank & shape array accepted.  See documentation for more details.
