⍝ This takes the following actions:
⍝ 1. Create a temp folder
⍝ 2. Open a Windows Explorer looking into that folder
⍝ 3. Copy the cheat sheet to that folder
⍝ 4. Copy the two CSS files to that folder
⍝ 5. Create an HTML file within that folder with...
⍝    * `linkCSS` being set to 1
⍝    * `cssUrl` pointing to the temp folder
⍝
⍝ That allows you to change the CSS files and watch the result of
⍝ the changes straight away. It also allows you to make temporary
⍝ changes to the cheat sheet in case it does not contain what you
⍝ want to change.
⍝
⍝ In case you made improving changes to the CSS files don't forget
⍝ to bring them back to MarkAPL's project folder, otherwise you
⍝ will loose your changes. Same hold true in case you've improved
⍝ the cheat sheet.
