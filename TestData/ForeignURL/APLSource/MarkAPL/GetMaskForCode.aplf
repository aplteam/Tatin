 r←GetMaskForCode txt;on;txt_;ind;in;i;noOf;k;bool
⍝ Returns a mask (vector of Booleans with zeros for all APL code in ⍵.
⍝ Does not fall over odd number of tick: the last one is then ignored.
⍝ Honors escaped backticks when found outside a code block.
⍝ This can only be solved in a loop because of, say, this:  `\\`
⍝ This is a code block with two backslashes, not an opening backtick followed by an escaped one!
