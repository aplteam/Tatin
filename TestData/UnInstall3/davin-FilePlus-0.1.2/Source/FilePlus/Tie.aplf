 tienum←{exclusive}Tie file;⎕TRAP;t;UC;relative
⍝ Tie or untie a FilePlus or standard APL component file
⍝ Provide a file name to tie to next available number; or number(s) to untie.
⍝ Tying a file returns the new file tie number (possibly negative, see below).
⍝ If a file name given is a full path, then that is the full file name.
⍝ If only a partial path is specified, then it is assumed to be relative to
⍝ the directory in which ⎕WSID resides.
⍝
⍝ This utility is only needed if:
⍝   * a relative file name is being supplied
⍝   * detection of an already-tied file (where possible) is desired
⍝   * special tying options are desired
⍝ otherwise a simple ⎕FTIE/⎕FSTIE is sufficient.
⍝ If the above options are desired (such as relative naming), it may be used
⍝ by itself (without using IO) to perform the work on standard files.
⍝
⍝ An optional left argument may be supplied with one to three values:
⍝   [1] Specify file tie number to use (if needed and available) [0=default]
⍝   [2] Exclusively tie (1) the file instead of share-tying it (0) [default]
⍝       This is ignored if the file is already tied.
⍝   [3] Require (1) read/write access to the file, or don't check (0) [default]
