⍝ Locate a key in the B-tree starting at the given root.
⍝ If full nodes are encountered along the way, pre-split them to leave enough room for insertions.
⍝ Right operand:
⍝      File component # containing the root of the B-tree.
⍝      If root<0, then this is a read-only operation starting at |root (don't pre-split nodes).
⍝ Right argument:
⍝      The key value to be located within the B-tree.
⍝ Result:
⍝      path[1]←Component # (scalar) that contains the data for the requested key
⍝          If path[1]=0 then the key was not found and path[2] is cmp/ndx where it should be inserted.
⍝      (1↓path)←Nested vector of the reverse-path back through the B-tree
⍝          (1⊃¨1↓path)←Component # of the tree node in the path
