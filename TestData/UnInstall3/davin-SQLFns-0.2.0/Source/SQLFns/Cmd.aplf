 sql←Cmd clauses;fn;dyad;left;right
⍝∇ Generate any of several SQL commands by providing only a data structure

⍝ If the right argument is unnested, assume it's a finished SQL command and just return it as-is
⍝ If it's nested, assume it's the right argument to Get (the most common operation) -- UNLESS:
⍝ if the first simple character = '∇', then we have a special case as follows:
⍝ The first item of the nested vector is the name of the SQL-formatting function to be called,
⍝ with a '∇' added as the first character.  This is usually one of:
⍝       ∇Get, ∇Upd, ∇Ins, ∇Del
⍝ In such a case, the named subroutine is called and the remainder of the nested vector is
⍝ passed to it as a right argument.
⍝ Optionally, a left argument may also be passed to the subroutine.  In this case, start the
⍝ function name (after the '∇') with the '⍺' character.  This means that the next item in the
⍝ argument is to be passed as the left argument of the function call and any remainder is to be
⍝ passed as the right argument.  If more than one '⍺' is prepended, then multiple items are
⍝ taken from the input and used as the left argument.  (A single item is unnested before it is
⍝ passed.)  Mostly for future support, a '⍵' suffix character is also allowed to be appended
⍝ to the end of the function name to indicate that that many items of the input are to be passed
⍝ as a right argument to the subroutine, in the same way as the left argument items.
