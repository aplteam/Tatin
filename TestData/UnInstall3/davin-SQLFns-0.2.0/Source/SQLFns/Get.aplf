 sql←{options}Get clauses;select;from;where;order;group;having;unionall;t;quest
⍝∇ Generate a simple Select command using the items of the argument given
⍝∇ to pass to the subroutines Select, From, Where, OrderBy, GroupBy, & Having
⍝∇ and return the results catenated together into a whole SQL command.
⍝ Provide arguments in this order (the standard order of a SQL Select statement):
⍝       {select-fields} {from-tables} [where-terms] [order-fields] [group-fields] [having-fields]
⍝
⍝ Get can also take a nested matrix of arguments, where each row of the matrix is a separate
⍝ query in the above pattern.  A Select/Union statement will then be generated as the result
⍝ of Get.  Only the first three columns may be different in each row. [order-fields] may only
⍝ be specified once for the entire SQL command, so it should either appear only in one of the
⍝ rows (the remainder being empty) or it should be exactly duplicated in all rows in which it
⍝ appears.  [group-fields] and [having-fields] are not supported in Select/Union SQL commands.
⍝ The {select-fields} list from every row must produce the same number and type of fields.
⍝ By default, duplicate rows (from different queries) may be returned from the resulting SQL
⍝ command (i.e. it uses the UNION ALL operator).  This may be changed to use the UNION
⍝ operator instead to remove duplicate rows by specifying a Get-specific command option '∪'
⍝ (mnemonic for "unique") in the left argument.  Be advised that this duplicate-removal
⍝ request may require additional processing time for the database to perform.  All field names
⍝ are determined by those used in the first Select command and any Order By should use those
⍝ names (or ordinal numbers).
⍝
⍝ Another Get-specific command option is '?'.  A command option word may consist of one or
⍝ more '?' characters (e.g. '???') to indicate that those characters are to be prepended to
⍝ the (front of the) resulting SQL command.  This is merely a convenience option to avoid
⍝ having to explicitly catenate them for interfaces that use them.
