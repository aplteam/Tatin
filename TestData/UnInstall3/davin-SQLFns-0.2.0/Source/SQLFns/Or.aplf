 both←{left}Or right;pp;addp;cnt
⍝∇ Join two (or more) phrases together with a SQL 'Or' conjunction.
⍝ Handle cases where phrases may be empty.  (All-space phrases not supported.)
⍝ Allow argument(s) to be nested to specify multiple terms.
⍝ A special term of '()' causes non-empty results to be enclosed in parens.
⍝ A special term of '(,)' causes results to be enclosed in parens, but only if
⍝ there is more than one term being ORed together.  This assumes that the
⍝ arguments are individual terms that haven't already been combined.
