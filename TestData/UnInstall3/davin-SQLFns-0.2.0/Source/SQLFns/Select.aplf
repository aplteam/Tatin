 sql←{special}Select fields;t;quote;noquote
⍝∇ Generate a SQL Select clause given the database field names to select.
⍝
⍝ Right argument:
⍝   1.  Nested vector of field names, or a single text string if only one field
⍝
⍝   2.  Nested vector of field names, with any individual field name nested one level
⍝       deeper and containing a field/alias pair.  If only one field name is being
⍝       passed in, and it includes an alias, the whole list must still be nested to
⍝       depth 3, or else this function will assume that the field and its alias are
⍝       actually two different field names.
⍝
⍝   3.  Nested vector of field names, with any individual field name being preceded
⍝       by its alias and a "←" symbol within the text string
⍝       (i.e. <alias>←<realfieldname>).
⍝
⍝   4.  2-column matrix of field names in column 1 and aliases in column 2;
⍝       any field name with no alias may have a '' as its alias
⍝
⍝   An advanced option is available on options 2 and 4 to automatically call Math
⍝   implicitly.  This can be quite confusing, but is provided for use where it is
⍝   required.  To invoke Math functionality, any individual field name in those
⍝   structures may be nested one further level to create a nested vector in its
⍝   place.  The first item of the vector is the "expression" template for the
⍝   calculation and is passed to Math as its left argument and the remaining
⍝   nested items (which may themselves be nested as needed by Math) are provided
⍝   as its right argument.  The data must continue to be nested and structured as
⍝   if there were an alias, but any such alias may be specified as a '' (or left
⍝   out in #2) if it is not needed, as long as the argument depth is correct.
⍝   Calling Math directly (including the '⍎' option code) is usually much easier
⍝   and more readable, but occasionally there may be a requirement to perform this
⍝   operation using data structures alone, and this option is provided for that
⍝   purpose.
⍝
⍝ Left argument:
⍝   Optional; any special word(s) to insert into the command after the word 'Select',
⍝   such as 'Distinct' or 'Top 5'.
⍝
⍝   If the left argument contains an '⍎' character (as a separate text item),
⍝   that signals this function not to call "Quote" on any of the field names.
⍝
⍝ All field names and aliases will be checked for valid names using "Quote", unless
⍝ the "⍎" option is used in the left argument.  Further, "Quote" will itself suppress
⍝ quoting any name which itself contains the "⍎" character or is nested an extra
⍝ level deeper (the same depth as Math nesting).  A field name of '*' itself is
⍝ never quoted by "Quote", nor is any expression ending in '(*)'.
