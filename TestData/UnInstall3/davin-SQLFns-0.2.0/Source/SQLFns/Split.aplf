 {names}Split records;t;type;scalar;types;empty
⍝∇ Accept a nested array of data with field names at the top of each column
⍝∇ (such as that returned by ADOGet with a '?Select...' command) and split
⍝∇ each column into a (nested) vector in semi-global variables named after
⍝∇ each field (column header).
⍝
⍝ Field names will be converted into legal APL variable names, or specific
⍝   variable names or alternate variable names may be provided instead.
⍝ The field names may be passed as a vector left argument instead of as
⍝   the first row of the right argument data matrix.
⍝ If the field names are passed as a left argument and the right argument
⍝   is a data vector instead of a matrix, then the data is assumed to be
⍝   exactly one data record and the resulting variable names will contain
⍝   simple (unnested) character vectors and numeric scalars instead of
⍝   nested vectors of character vectors and numeric vectors.
⍝ If the field names are passed as a left argument and the right argument
⍝   is an empty matrix (no records), then the left argument may optionally
⍝   also contain data type codes so that appropriately-typed empty arrays
⍝   may be used when creating the split variables.  To use this feature,
⍝   make the left argument a matrix where [1;] is the field/variable name
⍝   list and [2;] is the data type codes to use for each of them.
⍝   Data type codes may be ADO field type numbers or may be composed of
⍝   0 (for numeric fields) and '' (for character fields) for easier manual
⍝   use.  This feature may not be used when Split is called monadically
⍝   (with the field names at the top of the data matrix).
⍝   If this feature is not used and no records are present, then the data
⍝   type of all variables will be text (if called monadically) or will
⍝   match that of the first field (if called dyadically).

⍝ Examples:
⍝   Split ADOGet '?Select Name, Address, Phone From Customers'
⍝   Split 'CustName' 'CustAddr' 'CustPhone'⍪ADOGet 'Select Name, Address, Phone From Customers'
⍝   'CustName' 'CustAddr' 'CustPhone' Split ADOGet 'Select Name, Address, Phone From Customers'
⍝   ('Name' 'Addr' 'Phone',[.5] '' '' 0) Split ADOGet 'Select Name, Address, Phone From Customers'
⍝   x←ADOGet '??Select Name, Address, Phone From Customers' ⋄ x[1 2;] Split 2 0↓x
